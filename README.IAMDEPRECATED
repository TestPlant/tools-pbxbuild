PBXBUILD IS NO LONGER BEING ACTIVELY MAINTAINED.  PLEASE USE BUILDTOOL

To use buildtool you must first build the Xcode framework in dev-libs and
install it, then build the buildtool command line tool and install it.

The buildtool takes the project bundle name as an argument or finds the bundle
in the current directory and builds it.
