GENERAL:
 
This tool converts XCode(tm) projects into GNUmakefiles and builds them.
Those GNUmakefiles may be the basis for further user modifications
in order to make up for the platform differences of GNUstep and OS X.
Currently OSX Version 3.9 and 4.2 project files are supported.

It works fairly well for small and medium sized projects.
However, this tool has no magic superpowers, especially:
	- It only processes a part of the project file necessary to
	  create generic GNUmakefiles
	- It cannot know about platform issues (e.g. whether there are
	  modifications needed in order to compile the OS X project
	  correctly on GNUstep)

BUILD / INSTALL:
Go to the project directory and type
make
make install

note: cmdline.c and cmdline.h are generated out of the file
optionsparser.ggo using GNU gengetopt
(www.gnu.org/software/gengetopt/gengetopt.html), so please
dont modify them directly.

USE:
getting help:                   pbxbuild -h

building a project 
in the current directory:       pbxbuild

generating the makefiles only:  pbxbuild -g

OUTPUT:
A directory pbxbuild is created. It contains an aggregate GNUmakefile and a
directory for every Target in the project with subproject
GNUmakefiles. The target directories have the source tree symlinked
into it.

CAUTION: 
Every invocation of pbxbuild removes the previous pbxbuild tree 
without warning!
